          <p>1. It Can Make You Feel Happier
          Exercise has been shown to improve your mood and decrease feelings of depression, anxiety and stress.It produces changes in the parts of the brain that regulate stress and anxiety. It can also increase brain sensitivity for the hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which relieve feelings of depression .</p>

          <p>2. It Can Help With Weight Loss
          Some studies have shown that inactivity is a major factor in weight gain and obesity.</p>

          <p>3. It Is Good for Your Muscles and Bones
          Exercise plays a vital role in building and maintaining strong muscles and bones.
          Physical activity like weight lifting can stimulate muscle building when paired with adequate protein intake.</p>

          <p>4. It Can Increase Your Energy Levels
          Exercise can be a real energy booster for healthy people, as well as those suffering from various medical conditions.
          One study found that six weeks of regular exercise reduced feelings of fatigue for 36 healthy people who had reported persistent fatigue.
          Furthermore, exercise can significantly increase energy levels for people suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and other serious illnesses.
          In fact, exercise seems to be more effective at combating CFS than other treatments, including passive therapies like relaxation and stretching, or no treatment at all.<p/>

          <p>5. It Can Reduce Your Risk of Chronic Disease
          Lack of regular physical activity is a primary cause of chronic disease.
          Regular exercise has been shown to improve.</p>

          <p>6. It Can Help Skin Health
          Your skin can be affected by the amount of oxidative stress in your body.
          Oxidative stress occurs when the body's antioxidant defenses cannot completely repair the damage that free radicals cause to cells. This can damage their internal structures and deteriorate your skin.
          Even though intense and exhaustive physical activity can contribute to oxidative damage, regular moderate exercise can increase your body's production of natural antioxidants, which help protect cells (29, 30).
          In the same way, exercise can stimulate blood flow and induce skin cell adaptations that can help delay the appearance of skin aging. </p>
