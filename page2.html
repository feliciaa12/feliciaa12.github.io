          1. It Can Make You Feel Happier
          Exercise has been shown to improve your mood and decrease feelings of depression, anxiety and stress (2).

          It produces changes in the parts of the brain that regulate stress and anxiety. It can also increase brain sensitivity for the hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which relieve feelings of depression (1).

          Additionally, exercise can increase the production of endorphins, which are known to help produce positive feelings and reduce the perception of pain (1).
          Furthermore, exercise has been shown to reduce symptoms in people suffering from anxiety. It can also help them be more aware of their mental state and practice distraction from their fears (1).
          Interestingly, it doesn't matter how intense your workout is. It seems that your mood can benefit from exercise no matter the intensity of the physical activity.
          In fact, a study in 24 women who had been diagnosed with depression showed that exercise of any intensity significantly decreased feelings of depression (3).
          The effects of exercise on mood are so powerful that choosing to exercise (or not) even makes a difference over short periods.
          One study asked 26 healthy men and women who normally exercised regularly to either continue exercising or stop exercising for two weeks. Those who stopped exercising experienced increases in negative mood (4).

          2. It Can Help With Weight Loss
          Some studies have shown that inactivity is a major factor in weight gain and obesity (5, 6).
          To understand the effect of exercise on weight reduction, it is important to understand the relationship between exercise and energy expenditure.
          Your body spends energy in three ways: digesting food, exercising and maintaining body functions like your heartbeat and breathing.

          3. It Is Good for Your Muscles and Bones
          Exercise plays a vital role in building and maintaining strong muscles and bones.
          Physical activity like weight lifting can stimulate muscle building when paired with adequate protein intake.

          This is because exercise helps release hormones that promote the ability of your muscles to absorb amino acids. This helps them grow and reduces their breakdown (12, 13).
          As people age, they tend to lose muscle mass and function, which can lead to injuries and disabilities. Practicing regular physical activity is essential to reducing muscle loss and maintaining strength as you age (14).

          4. It Can Increase Your Energy Levels
          Exercise can be a real energy booster for healthy people, as well as those suffering from various medical conditions (17, 18).
          One study found that six weeks of regular exercise reduced feelings of fatigue for 36 healthy people who had reported persistent fatigue (19).
          Furthermore, exercise can significantly increase energy levels for people suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and other serious illnesses (20, 21).
          In fact, exercise seems to be more effective at combating CFS than other treatments, including passive therapies like relaxation and stretching, or no treatment at all (20).

          5. It Can Reduce Your Risk of Chronic Disease
          Lack of regular physical activity is a primary cause of chronic disease (22).
          Regular exercise has been shown to improve.
          In contrast, a lack of regular exercise — even in the short term — can lead to significant increases in belly fat, which increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and early death (23).
          Therefore, daily physical activity is recommended to reduce belly fat and decrease the risk of developing these diseases (27, 28).

          6. It Can Help Skin Health
          Your skin can be affected by the amount of oxidative stress in your body.
          Oxidative stress occurs when the body's antioxidant defenses cannot completely repair the damage that free radicals cause to cells. This can damage their internal structures and deteriorate your skin.
          Even though intense and exhaustive physical activity can contribute to oxidative damage, regular moderate exercise can increase your body's production of natural antioxidants, which help protect cells (29, 30).
          In the same way, exercise can stimulate blood flow and induce skin cell adaptations that can help delay the appearance of skin aging (31).

          Moderate exercise can provide antioxidant protection and promote blood flow, which can protect your skin and delay signs of aging.
          7. It Can Help Your Brain Health and Memory
          Exercise can improve brain function and protect memory and thinking skills.
          To begin with, it increases your heart rate, which promotes the flow of blood and oxygen to your brain.
          It can also stimulate the production of hormones that can enhance the growth of brain cells.
          Moreover, the ability of exercise to prevent chronic disease can translate into benefits for your brain, since its function can be affected by these diseases (32).
          Regular physical activity is especially important in older adults since aging — combined with oxidative stress and inflammation — promotes changes in brain structure and function (33, 34).
          Exercise has been shown to cause the hippocampus, a part of the brain that's vital for memory and learning, to grow in size. This serves to increase mental function in older adults (33, 34, 35).
          Lastly, exercise has been shown to reduce changes in the brain that can cause Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia (36).

          hat either aerobic exercise alone or aerobic exercise combined with resistance training can equally help sleep quality (44).

          Engaging in regular exercise can strengthen the cardiovascular system, improve blood circulation, tone muscles and enhance flexibility.
          Physical activity can improve sexual performance and sexual pleasure, as well as increase the frequency of sexual activity.
          A group of women in their 40s observed that they experienced orgasms more frequently when they incorporated more strenuous exercise, such as sprints, boot camps and weight training, into their lifestyles.
          Also, among a group of 178 healthy men, the men that reported more exercise hours per week had higher sexual function scores.
          One study found that a simple routine of a six-minute walk around the house helped 41 men reduce their erectile dysfunction symptoms by 71%.
          Another study performed in 78 sedentary men revealed how 60 minutes of walking per day (three and a half days per week, on average) improved their sexual behavior, including frequency, adequate functioning and satisfaction.
          What's more, a study demonstrated that women suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome, which can reduce sex drive, increased their sex drive with regular resistance training for 16 weeks (.
